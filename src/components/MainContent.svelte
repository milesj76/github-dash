The object of the game is to start with any actor or actress who has been in a movie and connect them to Kevin Bacon in the smallest number of links possible. Two people are linked if they've been in a movie together. We do not consider links through television shows, made-for-tv movies, writers, producers, directors, etc."

            content: "Then we can count how many links were necessary and assign the actor or actress a Bacon number. Bacon numbers higher than 4 are very rare. In the example above, Mary Pickford has a Bacon number of 3. The Oracle uses the data from Wikipedia and can give you the shortest path from every actor and actress that can be connected to Kevin Bacon."

Using an open-source script, we produce a JSON file with 128,000 films and 358,000 actors and actresses. There is a database service running at all times that stores the database file in memory. It is written in C for maximum CPU and memory efficiency. The service handles three different types of requests:"

            content: "There are several PHP pages -- one for each of the above types of queries -- that run on the Oracle of Bacon web server, which all connect to the database service using TCP. The database service uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between pairs of actors. If you want to dig further into how shortest-path algorithms work, I recommend the textbook by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein as an excellent place to start. Other algorithms textbooks are likely to cover the subject as well, if Introduction to Algorithms isn't available. You may also look at materials that I wrote to explain graph algorithms (including BFS) to Duke undergraduate CS students here."
